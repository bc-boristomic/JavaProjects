				<h2>Birdman</h2>

				<p><a class="bird" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_(film)">Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)</a>, commonly referred to as simply Birdman, is a 2014 American black comedy-drama film directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu. It was written by Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo. The film stars Michael Keaton with a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. The story follows Riggan Thomson (Keaton), a faded Hollywood actor famous for his role as superhero "Birdman", as he struggles to mount a <a class="bird" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre">Broadway</a> adaptation of a short story by <a class="bird" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Carver"> Raymond Carver</a>.</p>
				<p>Most of Birdman appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea Iñárritu had from the film's conception. Such an effect required an atypical production approach, and many elements of post-production required consideration before principal photography. The script took two years to write, the cast went through several weeks of meticulous rehearsals, and during shooting takes were cut for the slightest mishaps. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.</p>
				<p>Birdman had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14, grossing more than $103 million worldwide. The film garnered wide critical praise, and won the <a class="bird" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>, along with the Best Director for Iñárritu, the Best Original Screenplay, and the Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with The Grand Budapest Hotel for being the most nominated film of the Academy's 87th annual awards ceremony. It also won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards,[5] as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.</p>
